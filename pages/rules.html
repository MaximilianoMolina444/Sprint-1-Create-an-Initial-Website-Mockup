      </aside>
      <section id="rules">
        <h4>SPORTSMANSHIP</h4>
        <p>
          The common interest that members of the Association share is to
          inspire youth to practice the ideals of sportsmanship and fair play.
          Any player, coach, team, parent, spectator, administrator or referee
          whose behavior detracts from this purpose is subject to disciplinary
          action regardless of technical hockey background, expertise,
          accomplishments or standing.
        </p>
        <h4>IHF FIELD REGULATIONS</h4>
        <p>
          <strong>1. DIMENSIONS.</strong>IHF Law 1 provides for flexible
          external field dimensions within a given maximum and minimum width and
          length. These dimensions should be adhered to for all fields used by
          teams under 12 and older.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>2. COMPETITION FIELDS.</strong> Fields used within the
          competition program must be a minimum of 100 x 60 yards.Leagues,
          districts or associations participating in the state competition
          program that are unable to provide a field that meets these minimum
          requirements must advise the State Competition Board which will assign
          its Fields Committee to inspect the field and recommend to the Board
          whether or not a waiver of the minimum dimensions should be granted.
          Teams from leagues, districts or associations that are unable to
          provide an acceptable field may be required to play all their games
          away.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>3. FIELDS USED BY YOUNG AGE GROUPS</strong>
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>a. U-6 play on a field approximately 20 X 40 yards with no penalty areas. Fields 
            for older age groups should be progressively larger</li>
          <li>b. U-8 plays on a field 40-50 yards in length and 20-30 yards width.</li>
          <li>c. U-10 play on a field 70-80 yards in length and 40-50 yards in width.</li>
          <li>d. In addition, fields used by young age groups may have their internal 
            dimensions and size of goal similarly modified.</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>ALL-PLAY</h4>
        <p>All-play means that every recreation player on every team shall play atleast 
          fifty percent of each game. Coaches in the competition program are encouraged 
          to play their players 50% of each game. 
          o A Coach shall be permitted to not play a player 50% of each game 
          under special circumstances, e.g., unexcused absences from practice 
          and/or games, ungentlemanly conduct at practice and/or games, and 
          injuries.</p>
